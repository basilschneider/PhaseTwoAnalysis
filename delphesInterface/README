This directory contains the code to produce an ntuple in the same format as
from the NTupler in this repository based on Delphes output for simple
mixing of FullSim and Delphes samples.

For setup please run setup.sh (having set up the CMS environment 'cmsenv')
after that (having set up the CMS environment 'cmsenv')
'source env.sh'

The developing ntupler is in 'ntupler'.

This part is under development!
